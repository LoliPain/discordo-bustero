## What's next?

Discordo default case after first launch is:

1. Configure the server link
> Optionally you can follow that steps if it is necessary
> > 1.1. To configure the .txt [*(or get created yet)*](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt) list of words for Discordo vocabulary
> >
> > 1.2. If you do previous step, you need to specify **Channel ID** of server [*(how to get it?)*](https://github.com/P2LOVE/discordo-bustero/wiki/Developer-mode-guide#channel-id)
> >
> > 1.3. Server have [terms of use checkbox](https://lolipa.in/static/img/Discord_oqV6LFqtaK.png)? Not a problem! Just tell Discordo about it now
> >
> > 1.4. Greedy server mod bots want to send an [emoji reaction](https://lolipa.in/static/img/Discord_gTAHHw0ZWJ.png)? Ok. [*Where (message ID)*](https://github.com/P2LOVE/discordo-bustero/wiki/Developer-mode-guide#message-id) and [*What (emoji ID)*](https://github.com/P2LOVE/discordo-bustero/wiki/Developer-mode-guide#emoji-id)?
> > 
> > 1.5. What? **CAPTCHA???** Chill, and read [that article](https://github.com/P2LOVE/discordo-bustero/wiki/Captcha-guide)!
 

2. Now Discordo know everything about that server! Let's go tell something about conditionals
> **Every single instances** of Discordo using new user data. You need to get token!
> > 2.1. Enter the ***login* & *password***. For any account **without 2FA** that should work!
> >
> > 2.2. If you got a **token**, choose that option and paste it!

## What is all this for?

#### TLDR: `stack accounts, farm server-bot level`

### Explained case:
- Some server features unlock only after reaching some [activity level](https://lolipa.in/static/img/opera_l1Ew8xOtaT.png).
- - If you need many boosted level accounts you can feel free to use it.
- Server fake activity.
- - For some reason if you need chat activity on your server use it.
